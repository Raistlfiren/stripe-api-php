[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jlinn/stripe-api-php.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jlinn/stripe-api-php)

Stripe has built a very well-designed REST API to give developers access to their payment processing services. Their official PHP client library, while functional and flexible, left a bit to be desired in the ease of use department. This library aims to provide all of the functionality included in the official library while being extremely self-explanatory.

## Installing via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
```bash
$ php composer.phar require jlinn/stripe-api-php:~1.0
```
